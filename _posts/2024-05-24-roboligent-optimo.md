Impedance-controlled movements
The manipulator's trajectory and position are impedance-controlled at all times, delivering safe and compliant behaviors even when lifting a heavy object.

Highly dynamic interaction
The robot dynamically interacts with objects with a precisely intended force and appropriate compliance.

Gentle interaction with human​
The robot delivers highly smooth and natural movements and sensations during interaction with humans and provides the right amount of assistance.

Robust object manipulation​
The compliant manipulation absorbs positional uncertainties, increasing success rates and allowing for creative movements.

Sensitive haptic rendering
The robot can create even a subtle feeling, such as the sensation of inserting a needle into skin.

As strong as regular robots
The robot's extreme sensitivity does not mean it is weak. It is as strong as lifting 15-pound objects in a gantry pose and heavier objects at a curling mode.
